E.D.T.\nAdvertisementSAN FRANCISCO —  Jake Peavy considers himself a No. 1 starter regardless of when he pitches in San Francisco\'s rotation. All he cares about is delivering every fifth day, especially as September approaches with the World Series champion Giants in another tight playoff chase.Buster Posey followed Brandon Belt\'s leadoff triple in the sixth inning with a go-ahead double, Peavy won for the second time in six starts, and the Giants beat the Cubs 4-2 on Wednesday night to stop Chicago\'s six-game winning streak."I don\'t think it was a secret we needed this one," Peavy said. "When you get those starts every five days, they mean the world to you. When you know your team needs you, you do everything you can do. That\'s not promising anything in the future or even tonight, just the effort level is going to be all it could ever be."Kelby Tomlinson added an RBI double of his own in the sixth against Kyle Hendricks as the Giants ended a three-game slide with their second victory in seven games. Nori Aoki homered for San Francisco.With their first win in six meetings this month against the Cubs, San Francisco avoided its first six-game skid in the series since 1993-94."We weren\'t going to win them all. Sorry. I wanted to, but I knew it wasn\'t going to happen," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.Peavy (4-6) allowed five hits and two runs, struck out three and walked three in 6 1-3 innings to beat the Cubs for the second time in his last six outings against them. He took a 2-0 loss at Wrigley Field on Aug. 9.Peavy\'s bullpen backed him, too, with lefty Javier Lopez contributing his 19th straight scoreless appearance. Lopez and Hunter Strickland each had a strikeout to get through the seventh with runners on second and third.Sergio Romo pitched the eighth and Santiago Casilla finished with a perfect ninth and two strikeouts for his 31st save.After Chicago grabbed a two-run lead in the first, Aoki homered to start the bottom half for his fourth career leadoff homer and second this year.

E.D.T.\nAdvertisementSAN FRANCISCO —  Jake Peavy considers himself a No. 1 starter regardless of when he pitches in San Francisco\'s rotation. All he cares about is delivering every fifth day, especially as September approaches with the World Series champion Giants in another tight playoff chase.Buster Posey followed Brandon Belt\'s leadoff triple in the sixth inning with a go-ahead double, Peavy won for the second time in six starts, and the Giants beat the Cubs 4-2 on Wednesday night to stop Chicago\'s six-game winning streak."I don\'t think it was a secret we needed this one," Peavy said. "When you get those starts every five days, they mean the world to you. When you know your team needs you, you do everything you can do. That\'s not promising anything in the future or even tonight, just the effort level is going to be all it could ever be."Kelby Tomlinson added an RBI double of his own in the sixth against Kyle Hendricks as the Giants ended a three-game slide with their second victory in seven games. Nori Aoki homered for San Francisco.With their first win in six meetings this month against the Cubs, San Francisco avoided its first six-game skid in the series since 1993-94."We weren\'t going to win them all. Sorry. I wanted to, but I knew it wasn\'t going to happen," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.Peavy (4-6) allowed five hits and two runs, struck out three and walked three in 6 1-3 innings to beat the Cubs for the second time in his last six outings against them. He took a 2-0 loss at Wrigley Field on Aug. 9.Peavy\'s bullpen backed him, too, with lefty Javier Lopez contributing his 19th straight scoreless appearance. Lopez and Hunter Strickland each had a strikeout to get through the seventh with runners on second and third.Sergio Romo pitched the eighth and Santiago Casilla finished with a perfect ninth and two strikeouts for his 31st save.After Chicago grabbed a two-run lead in the first, Aoki homered to start the bottom half for his fourth career leadoff homer and second this year. He also hit one May 3 against the Angels.Kyle Schwarber began the game with a unique, 20-foot double on an infield popup. Peavy and catcher Posey both went for it and Posey got out of the way at the last second, knocking the pitcher over in the process.Addison Russell popped up in the third and first baseman Belt and third baseman Matt Duffy met on the mound chasing it down, with Belt making the catch.Hendricks (6-6) saw his winless stretch reach three starts for the Cubs, who lost for only the sixth time in their last 21 road games dating to June 30.Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford sat out after experiencing tightness in his left side following a 12-pitch, sixth-inning strikeout Tuesday night.

"How many times have you seen guys break it up in the ninth? It happens. Guys really lock in and if you make a mistake guys can hit it."Verlander (2-6) retired the next three batters after Iannetta, who is hitting .188, to finish his seventh career shutout and first in the regular season since May 18, 2012, against Pittsburgh.

He took one into the ninth in that 2012 shutout against the Pirates before Josh Harrison broke it up with one out.Verlander is a different pitcher now, no longer reaching triple digits on the radar gun with regularity. He showed Wednesday how tough he can still be."You don\'t need 100 (mph) — 97 plays," he said. "I think going back to spring training, my last start there when I hurt myself, felt like the ball was jumping out of my hand better than it had in a while.

He won only once in his first 12 outings.In July, he allowed seven runs over 3 2-3 innings against Baltimore and was booed as he left the mound — the first time that had happened in his Tigers career.In seven starts since that game, he\'s posted a 1.38 ERA and struck out 49 while walking only eight."He spotted everything, all night," catcher James McCann said. "He had all of his pitches working, spotting them, followed the game plan, stuck with it."Verlander\'s latest gem came five days after Houston right-hander Mike Fiers tossed the fifth no-hitter in the majors this season.Four times now in 2015 a no-hit bid has been broken up in the ninth inning.Verlander struck out five consecutive batters before walking David Murphy on four pitches to start the eighth, including Mike Trout looking at a breaking ball for the second out in the seventh.

E.D.T.\nAdvertisementARLINGTON, Texas —  Edwin Encarnacion hit a grand slam to extend his hitting streak to 21 games, helping David Price get a win on his 30th birthday in Toronto's 12-4 victory against the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night.Encarnacion sent his 26th homer into the Blue Jays' bullpen in left-center after Kevin Pillar opened a six-run sixth inning with a long ball that chased Texas starter Colby Lewis (14-6). Lewis issued four of a season-high 11 walks by Rangers pitchers.Pitching on his birthday for the first time in the majors, Price (13-4) threw five scoreless innings after allowing Adrian Beltre's two-run homer in the first.The AL East-leading Blue Jays won their fifth straight, while the Rangers dropped a half-game behind Minnesota in the race for the second AL wild card.Jose Bautista walked four times and scored twice as Toronto went two games up in the division on the New York Yankees, who lost to Houston 6-2. The Astros moved 5 1/2 games ahead of Texas atop the AL West.Lewis threw two of three wild pitches by the Rangers — both during a 10-pitch at-bat that ended with former Texas player Justin Smoak's two-run homer to break a 2-all tie in the fifth inning. Smoak's 13th long ball hit off the facade of the upper deck in right field and extended Toronto's franchise record to 16 straight road games with a homer.Encarnacion's second grand slam of the season — both against the Rangers — and the eighth of his career ended a stretch of six straight batters reaching to start the sixth.

Bumgarner has two complete games and a 1.42 ERA during his four-start winning streak, with 41 strikeouts and two walks in that span. He is 2-0 with a 0.75 ERA in his last four starts against the Cubs. The 25-year-old lefty also has been among the Giants' most dangerous hitters lately, going 4 for 12 with two homers in his last five games — including two pinch-hit appearances. The Cubs can add more space between themselves and the Giants, their closest competitors for the second NL wild card.BACK ON THE HORSEZack Greinke (13-3, 1.67 ERA) tries to rebound after allowing a season-high two homers in a loss to Houston his last time out. The Dodgers ace had won eight consecutive decisions prior to that defeat, which came amid a five-game losing streak that Los Angeles snapped against Cincinnati on Tuesday. Rookie right-hander Anthony DeSclafani goes for the Reds.CRUZ CONTROLNelson Cruz looks to reach the 40-homer mark for the second consecutive year, one day after slugging his major league-leading 39th long ball. The Mariners slugger set a career high with 40 homers last year with Baltimore. The 35-year-old Cruz has been on a tear since mid-July, slugging 17 homers while batting .358 in his last 32 games.BACK IN THE ROUTINEFresh off his first professional save, Minnesota lefty Tommy Milone (6-3, 3.69 ERA) returns to the rotation for the series finale at Tampa Bay. Milone was pressed into relief duty due to a depleted bullpen last Sunday and worked a perfect inning in the Twins' 4-3, 12-inning win at Baltimore. Drew Smyly goes for the Rays in his third start since returning from a torn labrum in his left shoulder. He shut out Oakland over 5 2-3 innings in his most recent outing.OH, BROTHERNationals rookie Joe Ross (4-5) takes the mound in the series finale against San Diego one night after older brother Tyson Ross started for the Padres in Washington.

The judges held, in a 2-to-1 decision, that New Jersey’s efforts to allow its casinos and racetracks to take bets violated the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or Paspa, which was passed in 1992.“We acknowledge New Jersey’s salutary purpose in attempting to revive its troubled casino and racetrack industries,” the opinion said. “We now turn to the primary question before us: whether the 2014 law violates Paspa. We hold that it does.”It was the latest development in a more than three-year battle pitting New Jersey against national sports organizations over the state’s efforts to expand gambling to sports events, and comes at a time when the appetite for sports wagering is at an all-time high. It has been closely followed by lawmakers across the nation who see legalized sports betting as an opportunity to shore up sagging state budgets with taxes on a pastime already done illegally by tens of millions of Americans.An insightful and occasionally amusing package of the sports journalism you need today, delivered to your inbox by New York Times reporters and editors.“The bigger winner today is the daily fantasy companies who now have the legal sports gambling space all to themselves for years to come,” said Daniel L. Wallach, a sports and gambling lawyer at Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “The sports leagues benefited again as well, because now they get to control the timing of when and how legal sports betting eventually gets implemented.”Fantasy sports operate under an exemption to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which outlawed online poker and sports betting. Lobbyists from the professional sports leagues successfully pushed to have fantasy play deemed a game of skill. Most states permit the games, but in Arizona, Montana, Louisiana, Iowa and Washington, they are illegal.While 57 million people in the United States and Canada participated in fantasy sports this year, according to research conducted by Ipsos — a market research company — for the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, it is dwarfed by the sheer scale of illegal gambling, where $400 billion annually is bet globally, according to law enforcement and gaming industry estimates.Still, the two biggest fantasy operators — FanDuel and DraftKings — have each been valued at more than $1 billion.Each has attracted investment — FanDuel from the N.B.A. and DraftKings from Major League Baseball — and landed sponsorship deals with dozens of teams from those leagues as well as the N.H.L and the N.F.L. They have been joined by Yahoo, which began daily and weekly fantasy games last month. Yahoo’s vast reach has the ability to entice tens of millions of young men — a coveted audience — to bet on the performances of individual players.AdvertisementAdvertisementN.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has said he was in favor of legalized sports gambling, acknowledging that it drove interest and was going on with or without the approval of sports leagues.Yet the N.B.A. joined the N.C.A.A., the N.F.L., the N.H.L., and Major League Baseball in the suit against New Jersey, contending that sports betting in New Jersey would “irreparably” corrupt sports in the United States.“We agree with the Third Circuit’s decision reaffirming that the appropriate path to legal sports betting is through Congress,” said Mike Bass, an N.B.A. spokesman. “We continue to support a federal legislative solution that would protect the integrity of the game while allowing those who engage in sports betting to do so in a legal and safe manner.”The American Gaming Association, which represents the $240 billion casino industry in the United States, indicated the decision would not stop its efforts to bring legal sports gambling to a broader audience.“Today’s decision by the Third Circuit on sports betting and how gaming is regulated encourages deeper examination about the best path forward on this issue,” said Geoff Freeman, the group’s president and chief executive. “With Americans betting at least $140 billion on sports illegally each year, it’s clear that current law is not achieving its intended result.”State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat and the sponsor of the bill signed by Gov. Chris Christie, said state attorneys would ask the entire Third Circuit to hear the case. Mr. Lesniak said legalized sports wagering could eventually help the nearly 10,000 people who had lost jobs in Atlantic City as its casinos closed.He also said the professional sports leagues were “knee-deep in hypocrisy” in opposing the bill, especially the N.F.L., in which many teams have embraced the daily fantasy segment in which fans fill out lineups with current N.F.L. stars and play each other for money.The New England Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars are among at least five N.F.L teams that are installing or have already installed “fantasy lounges” in their stadiums. The lounges often look like a Nevada gambling lounge, provide up-to-the-minute fantasy updates and are equipped with high-definition televisions to watch games.“The N.F.L. will play three games in London at Wembley Stadium, where fans can sit in their seats and bet games,” Mr. Lesniak said. “They want to have their gambling through fantasy sports, and they want to control and run it.”The N.F.L declined to comment on the ruling. M.L.B. said in a statement that it was “pleased that the Third Circuit has adopted the position of the sports leagues and the N.C.A.A.”New Jersey voters in 2011 approved a constitutional amendment that would repeal a ban on sports league betting at casinos and racetracks.

The judges held, in a 2-to-1 decision, that New Jersey’s efforts to allow its casinos and racetracks to take bets violated the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or Paspa, which was passed in 1992.“We acknowledge New Jersey’s salutary purpose in attempting to revive its troubled casino and racetrack industries,” the opinion said. “We now turn to the primary question before us: whether the 2014 law violates Paspa. We hold that it does.”It was the latest development in a more than three-year battle pitting New Jersey against national sports organizations over the state’s efforts to expand gambling to sports events, and comes at a time when the appetite for sports wagering is at an all-time high. It has been closely followed by lawmakers across the nation who see legalized sports betting as an opportunity to shore up sagging state budgets with taxes on a pastime already done illegally by tens of millions of Americans.An insightful and occasionally amusing package of the sports journalism you need today, delivered to your inbox by New York Times reporters and editors.“The bigger winner today is the daily fantasy companies who now have the legal sports gambling space all to themselves for years to come,” said Daniel L. Wallach, a sports and gambling lawyer at Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “The sports leagues benefited again as well, because now they get to control the timing of when and how legal sports betting eventually gets implemented.”Fantasy sports operate under an exemption to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which outlawed online poker and sports betting. Lobbyists from the professional sports leagues successfully pushed to have fantasy play deemed a game of skill. Most states permit the games, but in Arizona, Montana, Louisiana, Iowa and Washington, they are illegal.While 57 million people in the United States and Canada participated in fantasy sports this year, according to research conducted by Ipsos — a market research company — for the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, it is dwarfed by the sheer scale of illegal gambling, where $400 billion annually is bet globally, according to law enforcement and gaming industry estimates.Still, the two biggest fantasy operators — FanDuel and DraftKings — have each been valued at more than $1 billion.Each has attracted investment — FanDuel from the N.B.A. and DraftKings from Major League Baseball — and landed sponsorship deals with dozens of teams from those leagues as well as the N.H.L and the N.F.L. They have been joined by Yahoo, which began daily and weekly fantasy games last month. Yahoo’s vast reach has the ability to entice tens of millions of young men — a coveted audience — to bet on the performances of individual players.AdvertisementAdvertisementN.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has said he was in favor of legalized sports gambling, acknowledging that it drove interest and was going on with or without the approval of sports leagues.Yet the N.B.A. joined the N.C.A.A., the N.F.L., the N.H.L., and Major League Baseball in the suit against New Jersey, contending that sports betting in New Jersey would “irreparably” corrupt sports in the United States.“We agree with the Third Circuit’s decision reaffirming that the appropriate path to legal sports betting is through Congress,” said Mike Bass, an N.B.A. spokesman. “We continue to support a federal legislative solution that would protect the integrity of the game while allowing those who engage in sports betting to do so in a legal and safe manner.”The American Gaming Association, which represents the $240 billion casino industry in the United States, indicated the decision would not stop its efforts to bring legal sports gambling to a broader audience.“Today’s decision by the Third Circuit on sports betting and how gaming is regulated encourages deeper examination about the best path forward on this issue,” said Geoff Freeman, the group’s president and chief executive. “With Americans betting at least $140 billion on sports illegally each year, it’s clear that current law is not achieving its intended result.”State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat and the sponsor of the bill signed by Gov. Chris Christie, said state attorneys would ask the entire Third Circuit to hear the case. Mr. Lesniak said legalized sports wagering could eventually help the nearly 10,000 people who had lost jobs in Atlantic City as its casinos closed.He also said the professional sports leagues were “knee-deep in hypocrisy” in opposing the bill, especially the N.F.L., in which many teams have embraced the daily fantasy segment in which fans fill out lineups with current N.F.L. stars and play each other for money.The New England Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars are among at least five N.F.L teams that are installing or have already installed “fantasy lounges” in their stadiums. The lounges often look like a Nevada gambling lounge, provide up-to-the-minute fantasy updates and are equipped with high-definition televisions to watch games.“The N.F.L. will play three games in London at Wembley Stadium, where fans can sit in their seats and bet games,” Mr. Lesniak said. “They want to have their gambling through fantasy sports, and they want to control and run it.”The N.F.L declined to comment on the ruling. M.L.B. said in a statement that it was “pleased that the Third Circuit has adopted the position of the sports leagues and the N.C.A.A.”New Jersey voters in 2011 approved a constitutional amendment that would repeal a ban on sports league betting at casinos and racetracks. In 2012, the New Jersey State Legislature passed a bill decriminalizing sports betting, which was challenged by the N.C.A.A. and the major professional sports leagues.In an earlier decision, the Third Circuit found that even if New Jersey could not sponsor or license sports betting by law, it was free to repeal any of its own prohibitions on sports betting, as long as it was privately regulated.The state used that decision to tailor its latest sports wagering strategy — repealing its own prohibition and allowing a private bookmaker, William Hill, to operate a sports gambling site.“It’s pretty clear to me that this matter is far from over,” said Joe Asher, president of William Hill U.S. “I remain convinced that legal sports betting will come to New Jersey.

His blood-alcohol level later tested at 0.30 percent, more than four times the legal limit, the complaint said.Sydor, 43, was charged with two counts of second-degree drunken driving because of the aggravating factor of having a child in the car, with a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a fine up to $3,000"It gets the point of being disturbing.

He also played 18 seasons in the NHL."We are aware of the reports regarding Darryl Sydor.

He had trouble finding his driver\'s license even though it was in his wallet. The officer smelled a strong odor of alcohol on Sydor\'s breath."On several occasions, defendant stopped and told his son, \'I\'m sorry,\'" the complaint said.The boy told Officer Zak Chlebeck they got lost on their way to a 6:30 p.m. game in Plymouth, and that his mother was in Canada visiting family."He was now crying and upset that his dad had been pulled over," the complaint said.

He was 90.His family announced his death.Playing with the Maple Leafs for the first six of his 13 National Hockey League seasons, Mortson was a key part of the team’s youth movement after World War II.Since he came from an Ontario mining region and was ready to fight at the drop of a stick, or even with one, he was known as Old Hardrock.He teamed with Jim Thomson in a defensive pairing that was among the league’s toughest. They were known as the Gold Dust Twins — a riff, according to a Maple Leafs team history, on Thomson’s ownership of a coal business, with Mortson his chief salesman.Mortson and Thomson took pride in the paucity of goals scored per game by opposing teams, whose onrushing forwards they were hammering. “Jimmy and I used to keep track of the goals against us when we were on the ice,” Mortson once told The Toronto Star, “and in six years, we averaged fewer than one goal.”Mortson played with Leafs teams that captured the Stanley Cup three consecutive times, from 1947 to 1949, and again in 1951. Teammates at varying times included centers Syl Apps, Ted Kennedy and Max Bentley and goalie Turk Broda, all future Hall of Famers.James Angus Mortson was born on Jan. 24, 1925, in New Liskeard, Ontario. He joined the Maple Leafs in the 1946-47 season.For all his roughhouse play, Mortson was adept at handling the puck and carrying it up ice. He was named to the all-N.H.L. first team for the 1949-50 season and played in All-Star Games four times as a Maple Leaf and four times with the Chicago Black Hawks, who obtained him in a trade in September 1952.Mortson led the N.H.L. in penalty minutes four times, amassing 1,390 minutes for his career. Though fights in N.H.L. All-Star Games are virtually unheard of, he engaged in a stick-swinging encounter with the Montreal Canadiens’ Ken Reardon at the end of the 1947 All-Star Game, and he fought with the Detroit Red Wings’ Gordie Howe in the second period of the 1948 game. Both games were played under a format in which the Leafs, as defending Stanley Cup champions, faced players from the other five teams.After playing for the Red Wings in his final season, Mortson concluded his N.H.L. career in January 1959 with 46 goals and 152 assists.He owned a food and drink business after his playing days.He is survived by his wife, Sheila; his sons, Jamie, Bruce and Scott; his daughters, Shelley Bamford, Gail Sokoloski and Kim Laforest; 17 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.The Leafs’ third consecutive Stanley Cup championship of the 1940s came after they finished the regular season with a 22-25-13 record, gaining the fourth and last playoff spot. As Mortson recalled it, their players lost $850 apiece, no small sum back then, as a result of their mediocre regular season.“Back in our day, if you could make an extra thousand dollars, it went a long way,” he told The Albuquerque Journal in 2006. “If you were in first place and won the Cup, you were good for $3,000.

Perhaps the new commute was too long for their previous driver.Let’s start by getting the terms straight. The fun machine that zips around between periods at hockey games and that most people call a Zamboni is, technically, an “ice resurfacer.” Zamboni is not the only company that makes the machines — Olympia is another ice-resurfacer manufacturer — but it is the only one that works as a verb. You’re not going to hear an arena operations manager ask an assistant to “Olympia that ice.”The Islanders have a lot of job vacancies. The team has also advertised to hire part-time ushers and ticket takers, customer-support representatives and systems technicians. But the Zamboni job is the marquee one.Cleaning the ice at an arena is much more difficult than it looks. A Zamboni is not a golf cart.The team is not looking for just anyone. The ad says the job requires five years behind the wheel of an ice resurfacer, three years working in a hockey arena, and a college degree. (Barclays Center officials declined to discuss the job opening in detail, so we do not know how much they are planning to pay or whether applicants will be allowed to take the rig out for a test drive on Flatbush Avenue.)The posting says that candidates must be able to walk, sit and “use hands to finger, handle or feel objects.” They must also be able to “balance; stoop, kneel, crouch or crawl; talk or hear; taste or smell.” (That’s right — talk or hear. Taste or smell. No need for both, apparently.) The ad also mandates “close vision.”There are non-Zamboni-related aspects to this new position, to be sure. The future assistant manager of arena operations will be required to “perform safety inspections,” “make necessary adjustments to hockey glass” and take “leadership in the setup and breakdown of chairs, tables, pipe and drape, rubber matting and carpets.”But the key task is getting behind the wheel of the big machine and circling the ice until it reaches an N.H.L. standard of quality.Chris Jennings, the ice rink manager at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, where the Flyers play, said it took him four to six months before he was really comfortable behind the wheel.The hardest part, he said, was adjusting to the obstructed view. “Imagine driving your car but sitting in your trunk,” he said. When driving a Zamboni, “you can’t see the entire right side.” Drivers deal with this by visually aligning lines engraved on the top of the machine with lines on the glass around the rink. “That way, you know you’re going straight,” Jennings said.An insightful and occasionally amusing package of the sports journalism you need today, delivered to your inbox by New York Times reporters and editors.Jennings, who has been operating an ice resurfacer for 10 years, said his fellow drivers generally started at community rinks before making their way to the N.H.L., where the standard was higher.As the regular season winds down in the N.H.L., Islanders fans are preparing for the team’s move to Barclays Center next season after 43 years at Nassau Coliseum.“Players are bigger in the N.H.L., so we have to focus a little more on the density of our ice surface,” Jennings said. “We want it to be as strong as it possibly can.”N.H.L. ice has an average thickness of one inch from the concrete floor to the top of the ice surface.The person the Islanders hire will join a Zamboni community of sorts. The Facility Operations Managers Association meets annually to talk shop. “We gather to talk about a lot of the stuff that we do, because we face a lot of the same challenges,” Jennings said.So if you’re “detail-oriented,” can “lift and/or move up to 75 pounds” and have a “passion for creating an exceptional experience” for fans, your dream job may be waiting in Brooklyn.A version of this article appears in print on August 8, 2015, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wanted: a Driver Skilled on Ice.

Still, Jeff Gorton, who replaced Glen Sather as general manager a month ago, managed to clear the necessary cap space to sign Stepan and stay below the salary threshold. Teams can go 10 percent above the cap until final rosters are announced in early October.Although Stepan’s deal took a long time, the Rangers’ corresponding moves indicated that it was a priority. In one of his final acts as Rangers general manager, Sather traded Carl Hagelin, a fan favorite, for a younger, cheaper power forward, Emerson Etem. The Rangers also dealt the backup goalie Cam Talbot and acquired Antti Raanta to be the backup next season.The moves saved the Rangers at least $2 million because Hagelin was eligible for arbitration and asking for a raise from his $2.4 million salary last season.

The judges held, in a 2-to-1 decision, that New Jersey’s efforts to allow its casinos and racetracks to take bets violated the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or Paspa, which was passed in 1992.“We acknowledge New Jersey’s salutary purpose in attempting to revive its troubled casino and racetrack industries,” the opinion said. “We now turn to the primary question before us: whether the 2014 law violates Paspa. We hold that it does.”It was the latest development in a more than three-year battle pitting New Jersey against national sports organizations over the state’s efforts to expand gambling to sports events, and comes at a time when the appetite for sports wagering is at an all-time high. It has been closely followed by lawmakers across the nation who see legalized sports betting as an opportunity to shore up sagging state budgets with taxes on a pastime already done illegally by tens of millions of Americans.An insightful and occasionally amusing package of the sports journalism you need today, delivered to your inbox by New York Times reporters and editors.“The bigger winner today is the daily fantasy companies who now have the legal sports gambling space all to themselves for years to come,” said Daniel L. Wallach, a sports and gambling lawyer at Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “The sports leagues benefited again as well, because now they get to control the timing of when and how legal sports betting eventually gets implemented.”Fantasy sports operate under an exemption to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which outlawed online poker and sports betting. Lobbyists from the professional sports leagues successfully pushed to have fantasy play deemed a game of skill. Most states permit the games, but in Arizona, Montana, Louisiana, Iowa and Washington, they are illegal.While 57 million people in the United States and Canada participated in fantasy sports this year, according to research conducted by Ipsos — a market research company — for the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, it is dwarfed by the sheer scale of illegal gambling, where $400 billion annually is bet globally, according to law enforcement and gaming industry estimates.Still, the two biggest fantasy operators — FanDuel and DraftKings — have each been valued at more than $1 billion.Each has attracted investment — FanDuel from the N.B.A. and DraftKings from Major League Baseball — and landed sponsorship deals with dozens of teams from those leagues as well as the N.H.L and the N.F.L. They have been joined by Yahoo, which began daily and weekly fantasy games last month.

The judges held, in a 2-to-1 decision, that New Jersey’s efforts to allow its casinos and racetracks to take bets violated the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or Paspa, which was passed in 1992.“We acknowledge New Jersey’s salutary purpose in attempting to revive its troubled casino and racetrack industries,” the opinion said. “We now turn to the primary question before us: whether the 2014 law violates Paspa. We hold that it does.”It was the latest development in a more than three-year battle pitting New Jersey against national sports organizations over the state’s efforts to expand gambling to sports events, and comes at a time when the appetite for sports wagering is at an all-time high. It has been closely followed by lawmakers across the nation who see legalized sports betting as an opportunity to shore up sagging state budgets with taxes on a pastime already done illegally by tens of millions of Americans.An insightful and occasionally amusing package of the sports journalism you need today, delivered to your inbox by New York Times reporters and editors.“The bigger winner today is the daily fantasy companies who now have the legal sports gambling space all to themselves for years to come,” said Daniel L. Wallach, a sports and gambling lawyer at Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “The sports leagues benefited again as well, because now they get to control the timing of when and how legal sports betting eventually gets implemented.”Fantasy sports operate under an exemption to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which outlawed online poker and sports betting. Lobbyists from the professional sports leagues successfully pushed to have fantasy play deemed a game of skill. Most states permit the games, but in Arizona, Montana, Louisiana, Iowa and Washington, they are illegal.While 57 million people in the United States and Canada participated in fantasy sports this year, according to research conducted by Ipsos — a market research company — for the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, it is dwarfed by the sheer scale of illegal gambling, where $400 billion annually is bet globally, according to law enforcement and gaming industry estimates.Still, the two biggest fantasy operators — FanDuel and DraftKings — have each been valued at more than $1 billion.Each has attracted investment — FanDuel from the N.B.A. and DraftKings from Major League Baseball — and landed sponsorship deals with dozens of teams from those leagues as well as the N.H.L and the N.F.L. They have been joined by Yahoo, which began daily and weekly fantasy games last month.

He was 90.His family announced his death.Playing with the Maple Leafs for the first six of his 13 National Hockey League seasons, Mortson was a key part of the team’s youth movement after World War II.Since he came from an Ontario mining region and was ready to fight at the drop of a stick, or even with one, he was known as Old Hardrock.He teamed with Jim Thomson in a defensive pairing that was among the league’s toughest. They were known as the Gold Dust Twins — a riff, according to a Maple Leafs team history, on Thomson’s ownership of a coal business, with Mortson his chief salesman.Mortson and Thomson took pride in the paucity of goals scored per game by opposing teams, whose onrushing forwards they were hammering. “Jimmy and I used to keep track of the goals against us when we were on the ice,” Mortson once told The Toronto Star, “and in six years, we averaged fewer than one goal.”Mortson played with Leafs teams that captured the Stanley Cup three consecutive times, from 1947 to 1949, and again in 1951. Teammates at varying times included centers Syl Apps, Ted Kennedy and Max Bentley and goalie Turk Broda, all future Hall of Famers.James Angus Mortson was born on Jan. 24, 1925, in New Liskeard, Ontario. He joined the Maple Leafs in the 1946-47 season.For all his roughhouse play, Mortson was adept at handling the puck and carrying it up ice. He was named to the all-N.H.L. first team for the 1949-50 season and played in All-Star Games four times as a Maple Leaf and four times with the Chicago Black Hawks, who obtained him in a trade in September 1952.Mortson led the N.H.L. in penalty minutes four times, amassing 1,390 minutes for his career. Though fights in N.H.L. All-Star Games are virtually unheard of, he engaged in a stick-swinging encounter with the Montreal Canadiens’ Ken Reardon at the end of the 1947 All-Star Game, and he fought with the Detroit Red Wings’ Gordie Howe in the second period of the 1948 game. Both games were played under a format in which the Leafs, as defending Stanley Cup champions, faced players from the other five teams.After playing for the Red Wings in his final season, Mortson concluded his N.H.L. career in January 1959 with 46 goals and 152 assists.He owned a food and drink business after his playing days.He is survived by his wife, Sheila; his sons, Jamie, Bruce and Scott; his daughters, Shelley Bamford, Gail Sokoloski and Kim Laforest; 17 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.The Leafs’ third consecutive Stanley Cup championship of the 1940s came after they finished the regular season with a 22-25-13 record, gaining the fourth and last playoff spot. As Mortson recalled it, their players lost $850 apiece, no small sum back then, as a result of their mediocre regular season.“Back in our day, if you could make an extra thousand dollars, it went a long way,” he told The Albuquerque Journal in 2006. “If you were in first place and won the Cup, you were good for $3,000.

Must Use Care in Icy Conditions.', "AdvertisementAdvertisementBy VICTOR MATHERAUG. 7, 2015\nAdvertisementAn ad posted online last month said that Barclays Center was looking to hire an assistant manager of arena operations to help with “planning and implementation of associated work tasks.”Huh?What that really means is that the Islanders, who are relocating to Brooklyn from Uniondale, N.Y., need a Zamboni driver. Perhaps the new commute was too long for their previous driver.Let’s start by getting the terms straight. The fun machine that zips around between periods at hockey games and that most people call a Zamboni is, technically, an “ice resurfacer.” Zamboni is not the only company that makes the machines — Olympia is another ice-resurfacer manufacturer — but it is the only one that works as a verb. You’re not going to hear an arena operations manager ask an assistant to “Olympia that ice.”The Islanders have a lot of job vacancies. The team has also advertised to hire part-time ushers and ticket takers, customer-support representatives and systems technicians. But the Zamboni job is the marquee one.Cleaning the ice at an arena is much more difficult than it looks. A Zamboni is not a golf cart.The team is not looking for just anyone. The ad says the job requires five years behind the wheel of an ice resurfacer, three years working in a hockey arena, and a college degree. (Barclays Center officials declined to discuss the job opening in detail, so we do not know how much they are planning to pay or whether applicants will be allowed to take the rig out for a test drive on Flatbush Avenue.)The posting says that candidates must be able to walk, sit and “use hands to finger, handle or feel objects.” They must also be able to “balance; stoop, kneel, crouch or crawl; talk or hear; taste or smell.” (That’s right — talk or hear. Taste or smell. No need for both, apparently.) The ad also mandates “close vision.”There are non-Zamboni-related aspects to this new position, to be sure. The future assistant manager of arena operations will be required to “perform safety inspections,” “make necessary adjustments to hockey glass” and take “leadership in the setup and breakdown of chairs, tables, pipe and drape, rubber matting and carpets.”But the key task is getting behind the wheel of the big machine and circling the ice until it reaches an N.H.L. standard of quality.Chris Jennings, the ice rink manager at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, where the Flyers play, said it took him four to six months before he was really comfortable behind the wheel.The hardest part, he said, was adjusting to the obstructed view. “Imagine driving your car but sitting in your trunk,” he said. When driving a Zamboni, “you can’t see the entire right side.” Drivers deal with this by visually aligning lines engraved on the top of the machine with lines on the glass around the rink. “That way, you know you’re going straight,” Jennings said.An insightful and occasionally amusing package of the sports journalism you need today, delivered to your inbox by New York Times reporters and editors.Jennings, who has been operating an ice resurfacer for 10 years, said his fellow drivers generally started at community rinks before making their way to the N.H.L., where the standard was higher.As the regular season winds down in the N.H.L., Islanders fans are preparing for the team’s move to Barclays Center next season after 43 years at Nassau Coliseum.“Players are bigger in the N.H.L., so we have to focus a little more on the density of our ice surface,” Jennings said. “We want it to be as strong as it possibly can.”N.H.L. ice has an average thickness of one inch from the concrete floor to the top of the ice surface.The person the Islanders hire will join a Zamboni community of sorts. The Facility Operations Managers Association meets annually to talk shop. “We gather to talk about a lot of the stuff that we do, because we face a lot of the same challenges,” Jennings said.So if you’re “detail-oriented,” can “lift and/or move up to 75 pounds” and have a “passion for creating an exceptional experience” for fans, your dream job may be waiting in Brooklyn.A version of this article appears in print on August 8, 2015, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wanted: a Driver Skilled on Ice.

When driving a Zamboni, “you can’t see the entire right side.” Drivers deal with this by visually aligning lines engraved on the top of the machine with lines on the glass around the rink. “That way, you know you’re going straight,” Jennings said.An insightful and occasionally amusing package of the sports journalism you need today, delivered to your inbox by New York Times reporters and editors.Jennings, who has been operating an ice resurfacer for 10 years, said his fellow drivers generally started at community rinks before making their way to the N.H.L., where the standard was higher.As the regular season winds down in the N.H.L., Islanders fans are preparing for the team’s move to Barclays Center next season after 43 years at Nassau Coliseum.“Players are bigger in the N.H.L., so we have to focus a little more on the density of our ice surface,” Jennings said. “We want it to be as strong as it possibly can.”N.H.L. ice has an average thickness of one inch from the concrete floor to the top of the ice surface.The person the Islanders hire will join a Zamboni community of sorts. The Facility Operations Managers Association meets annually to talk shop. “We gather to talk about a lot of the stuff that we do, because we face a lot of the same challenges,” Jennings said.So if you’re “detail-oriented,” can “lift and/or move up to 75 pounds” and have a “passion for creating an exceptional experience” for fans, your dream job may be waiting in Brooklyn.A version of this article appears in print on August 8, 2015, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wanted: a Driver Skilled on Ice.

Kolten Wong had an RBI double and Matt Carpenter a run-scoring single in the inning.Lackey (11-8) bounced back from a shaky start, giving up a solo homer to Paul Goldschmidt in the first inning and little else. Trevor Rosenthal worked around a walk in the ninth for his 40th save.St. Louis moved to 36 games over .500 (81-45), its highest since finishing the 2005 season plus-38. The Cardinals have won 12 of 13 against Arizona.Lackey had a streak of 12 straight quality starts snapped his last time out, allowing five runs and nine hits in six innings of a loss to San Diego.The right-hander was back on track against the Diamondbacks, getting them to chase breaking balls out of the strike zone for most of the game.Goldschmidt got a good piece of a ball in the strike zone in the first inning, hitting a 471-foot solo homer, his 25th of the season.

Kolten Wong had an RBI double and Matt Carpenter a run-scoring single in the inning.Lackey (11-8) bounced back from a shaky start, giving up a solo homer to Paul Goldschmidt in the first inning and little else. Trevor Rosenthal worked around a walk in the ninth for his 40th save.St. Louis moved to 36 games over .500 (81-45), its highest since finishing the 2005 season plus-38. The Cardinals have won 12 of 13 against Arizona.Lackey had a streak of 12 straight quality starts snapped his last time out, allowing five runs and nine hits in six innings of a loss to San Diego.The right-hander was back on track against the Diamondbacks, getting them to chase breaking balls out of the strike zone for most of the game.Goldschmidt got a good piece of a ball in the strike zone in the first inning, hitting a 471-foot solo homer, his 25th of the season.

E.D.T.\nAdvertisementDETROIT —  Justin Verlander leaned forward a bit, hoping this line drive would land foul.Then he arched his back in disappointment when the ball hit the line, kicking up chalk on its way to the left-field corner.Verlander lost a bid for his third no-hitter when Chris Iannetta hit a leadoff double in the ninth inning, and the Detroit Tigers beat the Los Angeles Angels 5-0 Wednesday night.Trying to become the sixth major leaguer to throw three no-hitters, Verlander settled instead for a one-hit shutout.He was an inch away from so much more."That\'s the toughest part of a no-hitter is getting through that last inning," Verlander said. "How many times have you seen guys break it up in the ninth? It happens. Guys really lock in and if you make a mistake guys can hit it."Verlander (2-6) retired the next three batters after Iannetta, who is hitting .188, to finish his seventh career shutout and first in the regular season since May 18, 2012, against Pittsburgh. The right-hander struck out nine and walked two in his first win since July 29.He faced only 28 hitters — one more than the minimum — after inducing double plays following both walks.Miguel Cabrera, J.D. Martinez and Nick Castellanos homered to help the Tigers stop a five-game slide.Verlander\'s most recent no-hitter came at Toronto on May 7, 2011. He also pitched one against Milwaukee on June 12, 2007.This effort marked the seventh time in the last five seasons Verlander carried a no-hit bid into at least the seventh inning. He took one into the ninth in that 2012 shutout against the Pirates before Josh Harrison broke it up with one out.Verlander is a different pitcher now, no longer reaching triple digits on the radar gun with regularity. He showed Wednesday how tough he can still be."You don\'t need 100 (mph) — 97 plays," he said. "I think going back to spring training, my last start there when I hurt myself, felt like the ball was jumping out of my hand better than it had in a while. It\'s nice to see that carry over and get some swings and misses on my fastball."Following a triceps injury in the spring, Verlander didn\'t make his first start this season until June 13. He won only once in his first 12 outings.In July, he allowed seven runs over 3 2-3 innings against Baltimore and was booed as he left the mound — the first time that had happened in his Tigers career.In seven starts since that game, he\'s posted a 1.38 ERA and struck out 49 while walking only eight."He spotted everything, all night," catcher James McCann said. "He had all of his pitches working, spotting them, followed the game plan, stuck with it."Verlander\'s latest gem came five days after Houston right-hander Mike Fiers tossed the fifth no-hitter in the majors this season.Four times now in 2015 a no-hit bid has been broken up in the ninth inning.Verlander struck out five consecutive batters before walking David Murphy on four pitches to start the eighth, including Mike Trout looking at a breaking ball for the second out in the seventh. Albert Pujols then went down swinging at an inside fastball.AdvertisementAdvertisement"You always start to think about it probably in the third or fourth inning. But I really keyed the seventh inning with Trout and Pujols coming up, saying, if I can get through this I\'ve got a good shot," Verlander said. "And I\'ve got to tip my cap to Iannetta. He hit a pretty good pitch. My fastball\'s been working for me all night. I went with it."Verlander\'s second career one-hitter was his first complete game since he shut out Oakland on the road in the decisive fifth game of the 2012 AL Division Series.Hector Santiago (7-8) allowed five runs and seven hits in 4 1-3 innings for the Angels.ELITE GROUPThe only major league pitchers to throw three or more no-hitters are Larry Corcoran (3 in the 1880s), Cy Young (3), Bob Feller (3), Sandy Koufax (4) and Nolan Ryan (7)."It\'d be nice to be in that group, especially some of the names in there," Verlander said. "I think Nolan Ryan had some ridiculous amount of no-hitters broken up in the ninth inning. It happens."ADJUSTMENTIannetta said before his last at-bat, he looked at video from 2011, when he was hitting better while using a leg kick and holding his hands high. He made an adjustment and broke up Verlander\'s no-hit bid."He pitched a great game. He\'s always great," Iannetta said. "He\'s a tough pitcher. He\'s one of the best in the game for a reason. He\'s been that way for a long time, and he is the same as he\'s always been."TRAINER\'S ROOMAngels: OF Grant Green (right knee) could have played in an emergency but was not used.Tigers: LHP Kyle Lobstein (left shoulder) made his fifth rehab start Tuesday night, going five innings and allowing one run for Triple-A Toledo.UP NEXTDetroit LHP Randy Wolf (0-1) will start Thursday, and the Angels are expected to call up RHP Matt Shoemaker from the minors.

The victory, combined with a loss by the Washington Nationals, gave the Mets a six-and-a-half-game lead in the National League East. During their current six-game winning streak, they have scored 64 runs.Soon after Collins took over, he changed some rules to lighten the disposition surrounding a team that was not performing well on the field.\xa0“One of the things we tried to do here was make it fun to be here,” Collins said. “Therefore, we’ve tried to create an atmosphere in the clubhouse that’s fun.”\xa0The culture shift was evident early in the afternoon. Several Mets, led by Juan Uribe, were singing along to pop songs by the Backstreet Boys, the popular boy band from the late 1990s. The mood was the epitome of relaxed.An insightful and occasionally amusing package of the sports journalism you need today, delivered to your inbox by New York Times reporters and editors.\xa0While the Mets were keeping things light, local television and radio broadcasts in Philadelphia were full of speculation about retaliation after tensions flared during the Mets’ win on Tuesday, when Hansel Robles threw a pitch before a Phillies batter was ready. But the events from the night before were far from the thoughts of the Mets’ players.“We talked with Hansel today; you can’t react like he did,” Collins said, referring to Robles’s staring toward the Phillies’ dugout after an inning-ending strikeout. “The other guys, they haven’t even brought it up today.”\xa0With clear minds, the Mets emerged to score three runs in the first inning off the Phillies’ Jerad Eickhoff, a rookie.The damage began with an innocuous fly ball off the bat of Curtis Granderson that was dropped by center fielder Odubel Herrera. Granderson later scored, along with Yoenis Cespedes and Michael Cuddyer.Eickhoff, who threw six scoreless innings in his first career start last Friday against Miami, escaped further damage by getting the last two outs with the bases loaded.Bartolo Colon started for the Mets, and he rebounded from an awful outing Friday\xa0at Colorado, when he did not make it out of the fourth inning after giving up seven runs and nine hits. He also delivered much-needed length for a bullpen that had been heavily used in the Mets’ recent slugfests.On Wednesday, Colon threw seven scoreless innings to improve to 11-11. He did not allow a Phillies runner beyond second base and struck out eight, including the side in the seventh.“This game was about Bartolo Colon,” Collins said. “We said he’s got to give us six innings, and he gave us more than that. I salute him. He did a great job.”After a shaky first inning, where Colon gave up three hits but left undamaged thanks to a double play that he helped start, the pitching coach Dan Warthen implored the 42-year-old Colon to rely on his changeup and breaking pitches. Colon said after the game through an interpreter that it felt as if he threw more changeups in Wednesday’s\xa0game than in any other over his 18-year career, but the strategy was successful.AdvertisementAdvertisementEickhoff also recovered admirably, retiring 16 consecutive batters after struggling in the first. Michael Conforto finally reached base on a two-out double in the sixth, and Uribe drove him home on a single up the middle.Cuddyer piled on two more runs in the eighth when he blasted his 10th home run of the season, scoring Daniel Murphy. It was the Mets’ 40th homer in August, which tied a team record for the most in a month, equaling their output from June 2006.\xa0The Mets were ahead by 6-0 going into the bottom of the eighth, but their bullpen let the Phillies get back into the game. It surrendered four runs, and the Phillies brought the go-ahead run to the plate with two outs, but Tyler Clippard struck out Darnell Sweeney to end the inning.\xa0The Mets added three runs in the ninth, giving Clippard a comfortable lead and returning to their jovial mood. Minutes after the game, loud cheers could be heard from inside the Mets’ clubhouse. The noise seeped through the thick concrete walls in the underbelly of Citizens Bank Park.Colon provided some insight for the cause for celebration.“It’s very important for me personally, but more for the team and the city,” he said of the team’s recent success. “We want to take this team all the way to the end and see how far we can go.”INSIDE PITCH\xa0STEVEN MATZ threw 56 pitches in a rehab start for Class AA Binghamton, striking out six, walking none and allowing one hit over six scoreless innings.\xa0A version of this article appears in print on August 27, 2015, on page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Mets Are in Harmony, With Bats and Voices.

He did not allow a Phillies runner beyond second base and struck out eight, including the side in the seventh.“This game was about Bartolo Colon,” Collins said. “We said he’s got to give us six innings, and he gave us more than that. I salute him. He did a great job.”After a shaky first inning, where Colon gave up three hits but left undamaged thanks to a double play that he helped start, the pitching coach Dan Warthen implored the 42-year-old Colon to rely on his changeup and breaking pitches. Colon said after the game through an interpreter that it felt as if he threw more changeups in Wednesday’s\xa0game than in any other over his 18-year career, but the strategy was successful.AdvertisementAdvertisementEickhoff also recovered admirably, retiring 16 consecutive batters after struggling in the first. Michael Conforto finally reached base on a two-out double in the sixth, and Uribe drove him home on a single up the middle.Cuddyer piled on two more runs in the eighth when he blasted his 10th home run of the season, scoring Daniel Murphy. It was the Mets’ 40th homer in August, which tied a team record for the most in a month, equaling their output from June 2006.\xa0The Mets were ahead by 6-0 going into the bottom of the eighth, but their bullpen let the Phillies get back into the game. It surrendered four runs, and the Phillies brought the go-ahead run to the plate with two outs, but Tyler Clippard struck out Darnell Sweeney to end the inning.\xa0The Mets added three runs in the ninth, giving Clippard a comfortable lead and returning to their jovial mood. Minutes after the game, loud cheers could be heard from inside the Mets’ clubhouse. The noise seeped through the thick concrete walls in the underbelly of Citizens Bank Park.Colon provided some insight for the cause for celebration.“It’s very important for me personally, but more for the team and the city,” he said of the team’s recent success. “We want to take this team all the way to the end and see how far we can go.”INSIDE PITCH\xa0STEVEN MATZ threw 56 pitches in a rehab start for Class AA Binghamton, striking out six, walking none and allowing one hit over six scoreless innings.\xa0A version of this article appears in print on August 27, 2015, on page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Mets Are in Harmony, With Bats and Voices.

They took a 6 1-2 game lead over second-place Washington, which lost 6-5 to San Diego.Cuddyer had an RBI double in the first inning off Jerad Eickhoff (1-1) and hit a two-run shot into the second deck in left field off Hector Neris in the eighth.The Mets have dominated the Phillies, winning eight straight, 11 of 12 this season and 23 of the last 28 meetings. They will go for a four-game sweep Thursday night with plenty of visiting fans chanting "Let\'s Go Mets!" in Philadelphia\'s cozy ballpark.After the teams tied an NL record by combining for 11 home runs on Monday, they connected for three on Tuesday and only one on Wednesday.Eickhoff, acquired in the trade that sent ace left-hander Cole Hamels to Texas, was impressive in his major league debut last Friday at Miami. He earned the win by pitching six scoreless innings. But the Mets jumped on him for three runs in the first.Cuddyer doubled in a run and scored on Michael Conforto\'s single to make it 3-0.Eickhoff retired 16 straight before Conforto hit a two-out double in the sixth.

Andres Blanco had an RBI groundout against Eric O\'Flaherty and Cameron Rupp hit a two-run double off Carlos Torres. Pinch-hitter Jeff Francoeur had an RBI single off Tyler Clippard, but the righty struck out Darnell Sweeney to leave two runners on.

They took a 6 1-2 game lead over second-place Washington, which lost 6-5 to San Diego.Cuddyer had an RBI double in the first inning off Jerad Eickhoff (1-1) and hit a two-run shot into the second deck in left field off Hector Neris in the eighth.The Mets have dominated the Phillies, winning eight straight, 11 of 12 this season and 23 of the last 28 meetings. They will go for a four-game sweep Thursday night with plenty of visiting fans chanting "Let\'s Go Mets!" in Philadelphia\'s cozy ballpark.After the teams tied an NL record by combining for 11 home runs on Monday, they connected for three on Tuesday and only one on Wednesday.Eickhoff, acquired in the trade that sent ace left-hander Cole Hamels to Texas, was impressive in his major league debut last Friday at Miami. He earned the win by pitching six scoreless innings. But the Mets jumped on him for three runs in the first.Cuddyer doubled in a run and scored on Michael Conforto\'s single to make it 3-0.Eickhoff retired 16 straight before Conforto hit a two-out double in the sixth. Juan Uribe drove him in with a single for a 4-0 lead.The Phillies scored seven runs off Jacob deGrom and five runs off Noah Syndergaard in the first two games, but did nothing against the 42-year-old Colon, who entered with a 4.90 ERA.They rallied against the bullpen in the eighth. Andres Blanco had an RBI groundout against Eric O\'Flaherty and Cameron Rupp hit a two-run double off Carlos Torres. Pinch-hitter Jeff Francoeur had an RBI single off Tyler Clippard, but the righty struck out Darnell Sweeney to leave two runners on.

Bumgarner has two complete games and a 1.42 ERA during his four-start winning streak, with 41 strikeouts and two walks in that span. He is 2-0 with a 0.75 ERA in his last four starts against the Cubs. The 25-year-old lefty also has been among the Giants' most dangerous hitters lately, going 4 for 12 with two homers in his last five games — including two pinch-hit appearances. The Cubs can add more space between themselves and the Giants, their closest competitors for the second NL wild card.BACK ON THE HORSEZack Greinke (13-3, 1.67 ERA) tries to rebound after allowing a season-high two homers in a loss to Houston his last time out. The Dodgers' ace had won eight consecutive decisions prior to that defeat, which came amid a five-game losing streak that Los Angeles snapped against Cincinnati on Tuesday. Rookie right-hander Anthony DeSclafani goes for the Reds.CRUZ CONTROLNelson Cruz looks to reach the 40-homer mark for the second consecutive year, one day after slugging his major league-leading 39th long ball. The Mariners' slugger set a career high with 40 homers last year with Baltimore. The 35-year-old Cruz has been on a tear since mid-July, slugging 17 homers while batting .358 in his last 32 games.BACK IN THE ROUTINEFresh off his first professional save, Minnesota lefty Tommy Milone (6-3, 3.69 ERA) returns to the rotation for the series finale at Tampa Bay. Milone was pressed into relief duty due to a depleted bullpen last Sunday and worked a perfect inning in the Twins' 4-3, 12-inning win at Baltimore.
